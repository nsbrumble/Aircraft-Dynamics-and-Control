%% Background
% This script will hold all of the calculations necessary in order to
% analyze the flight performance of the Boeing 737 aircraft. This section
% includes preliminary calculations that will aid in determining the
% performance parameters.

% Known parameters
g = 9.81;
R = 287;
T_sl = 288.16;
a1 = -6.5;
rho_sl = 1.225;
gamma = 1.4;

% Cruise conditions
Mach = 0.785;
h_ft = 35000;
h = h_ft*0.0003048;
T = T_sl+a1*h;
rho = rho_sl*(T/T_sl)^(-1-g/(a1*10^-3*R));
mu = 1.8*10^-5;

a = sqrt(gamma*R*T);       % Local speed of sound in m/s
V = a*Mach;                % Airspeed in m/s
Q = .5*rho*V^2;            % Dynamic Pressure in Pa

% Physical Measurements of Boeing 737
b = 33.4;
S = 140.8;                 % Planform Area in m^2
C = S/b;                   % Airfoil chord length in m
AR = b^2/S;                % Wing Aspect Ratio
W_lb = 90710;              % Weight of aircraft in lb
W = W_lb*4.44;             % Weight of aircraft in N

% Flow and Aerodynamic Forces
Re = rho*V*C/mu;           % Reynolds number of flight
cd = 1;                    % Drag coefficient from XFLR5
cl = 1;                    % Lift coefficient from XFLR5               
k = 
cD0 = 









%% Thrust Required at Cruise Conditions
% Cruise conditions imply that the aircraft is flying steadily at constant
% altitude. 


Lift_Drag = cl/cd;      % Lift to drag ratio
Thrust = W/Lift_Drag;   % Thrust required to maintain cruise conditions in N

fprintf('Thrust Required = %g [N]',Thrust)



%% Glide Range

%% Absolute and Service Ceiling

%% Minimum Turning Radius

%% Characteristic Airspeeds

%% Range
% Range quantifies how far an aircraft can fly without having to refuel. 

TSFC = 4;               % Thrust specific fuel consumption
